                    <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have the
                        ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t know how to
                        read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we understand that
                        you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on past events, and can
                        be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs are the perfect example
                        of this.

                        The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from
                        extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the
                        first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of
                        agriculture.

        <p>
            You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from
            whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
            mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered.
            Far up this mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
            desperately scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled
            <a href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
            boring-looking exit is labeled <a href="https://isp.example.net/">ISP™</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>.
            Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
            quickly out of the page.
